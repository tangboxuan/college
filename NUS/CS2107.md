Online Password Attack: 29 bits of entropy  
Offline Password Attack: 128 bits of entropy  

False Match Rate = Successful false matches / Attempted false matches  
False Non-Match Rate = Rejected genuine matches / Attempted genuine matches  
Lower threshold = More relaxed = Higher FMR and Lower FNMR  

M messages to T tags  
\>50% chance of same tag: if M > 1.17sqrt(T)  
P(collision) = 1 - e^(-(M^2)/2T)  
Let there be k elements of n bits, we select m random n bit strings  
P(one of m in k) = 1 - 2.7^(-km2^(-n))  
km = 2^n for P = 0.63, as 1 - 2.7^(-1) = 0.63  
Recommended length of digest double that of length of symmetric key
